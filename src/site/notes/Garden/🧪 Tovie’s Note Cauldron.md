# 🧪 Tovie’s Note Cauldron

_Where code incantations, game lore, OS alchemy (Arch/Omarchy), and rogue side-projects bubble together._  
Pull up a stool, mind the splash radius, and don’t lick the glowing green stuff. That’s for **production**.

---

## ✨ What is this?

**Tovie’s Note Cauldron** is my living library of half-tamed notes, sharp tips, and “definitely-not-cursed” snippets.  
I keep everything I learn (or break) about:

- **Code** — from one-liners to full rituals (scripts, patterns, pitfalls).
    
- **Games** — modding notes, configs, performance charms, and boss-fight autopsies.
    
- **OS Stuff** — mostly **Arch/Omarchy**: dotfiles, Hyprland tricks, drivers, and “why is Wayland like this?”
    
- **Other Projects** — automations, bots, weird hardware, and experiments I probably should not run as root.
    

> _Motto:_ “If it compiles, it’s an omen. If it runs, it’s a miracle. If it’s fast… I sacrificed something.”

## 📚 Contents (pick your poison)

### 🪄 Code Grimoire

- Snippets that actually work (after three moons and a rubber duck).
    
- Patterns, anti-patterns, and **how not to yeet your state**.
    
- Quick-cast spells:
    
    - `pipx + venv` sanity charms
        
    - Discord bot scaffolds
        
    - N8n + API incantations
        

### 🎮 Game Scrolls

- Mod lists with sane load orders (a novelty).
    
- Performance rituals (a.k.a. “why is my GPU screaming?”).
    
- Config presets and controller glyph runes.
    

### 🧬 OS Alchemy (Arch/Omarchy)

- Hyprland: rules, opacity, blur (the holy trinity of “vibes”).
    
- Nvidia on Wayland: rituals, runes, regrets.
    
- Eww widgets, systemd units, and pacman runebooks.
    

### 🔧 Project Lab

- Bots, automations, and webhook familiars.
    
- Homelab notes (cloudy with a chance of YAML).
    
- Random builds: from laser goblins to custom launchers.

## 🧭 How to Navigate

- **Tags** act like sigils: `#arch`, `#hyprland`, `#discord-bot`, `#n8n`, `#create-mod`, etc.
    
- **Short, linked notes** first. Deep dives live in sub-grimoires.
    
- **Code blocks** are copy-safe. If they bite, that’s on me (and also you).
    

```bash
# Ritual: spin a clean Python space
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip wheel
# if Arch hisses: use pipx or --break-system-packages (summon with caution)
```

## 🗝️ House Rules

- **Plain before arcane.** I’ll show the simple way, then the fancy way that impresses goblins.
    
- **Repeatable > Relatable.** Steps you can run twice without crying.
    
- **Honest errors.** I keep the oopsies—they’re the best teachers (and funniest).

## 🙋 FAQ (Frequently Arcane Queries)

**A:** _Like a baby deer on ice._ Pin versions. Take backups. Light a candle.

**Q:** Can I borrow a script?  
**A:** Absolutely. Credit is nice. Summoning circles optional.

**Q:** Why Arch/Omarchy?  
**A:** Because I enjoy freedom, control, and occasional pain.
